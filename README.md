## Wireframe


This project will consist of canvas
and will be formatted like a 2012 web games like y3 or y8

Title: Bird Time
Header: with a logo and additonal user features (log in) mainly for design rather than actually logging in

Two Aside: used as borders to center the canvas, the aside will be a background to set the theme of the website

Canvas: the main scene of where the game will take place

Section: below the canvas is the description of the game, and the controls

Footer: a footer will be at the bottom of the page for design purposes


## MVP Goals
One of the first forms of functionality I need to do is the hopping of the bird.
Then, create pipes that will randomize the gap of the pipes, and make the pipes go towards the bird
- click to start the game
- control the bird's hopping by clicking on the w key
- create pipes as obstacles
- create a function where pipes move towards the bird as soon as the game starts
- repeat the pipe function so that endless amounts of pipes go towards the bird, with different position of the gaps
- stop the game if the bird's hitbox comes in contact with the pipe
- display a point system to show you your results and a button to redo/play again

## STRETCH Goals
- adding 'skins' to the game -- ability to change the bird's appearance
- adding difficulties for player experience
- adding additional features like links as if it was a website
- provide the bird an animation by facing up and down depending on the process of the hopping
- provide a background with animation to display movement

## Post Project Reflection
A very challenging, yet achievable project. As I pitched this project, I believed it was too hard of a challenge for me to start with, but I was motivated and passionate to complete it!

During the process, it felt impossible sometimes. Research was done and nothing felt more alive after figuring out a problem, whether it's debugging or adding features.

It is absolutely absolutely wild how I designed this within three weeks of committing to coding. I am very proud of what I accomplished and I never felt more productive, genuinely.

## Sources Used
W3Schools, geeksforgeeks -- reminders on the syntax and what resources I have avaliable to me

aaarafat JS-Flappy-Bird github -- a similar project to find inspiration and strategies in order for me to figure out a way to implement their methods onto my project

Stackoverflow -- joining with the community and using open resources as a method of problem solving

OpenGameArt -- used for a background

Slay the Ogre project -- a program I used as reference for canvas
